# ten_min_wasm_physics
Port of physics simulation demos from the great YouTube channel "Ten Minute Physics" to WASM with Rust. All credits belong to Matthias MÃ¼ller and the great lectures on his [website](https://matthias-research.github.io/pages/tenMinutePhysics/) and [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTG_vrRdKYfrpqCv_WV4eyA). 

The goal of this repository is to:
- port physics simulation code and demos to browser using Rust + WASM
- come up with reusable components for building and simulating your own scenes

Rewritting Ten minute physics to WASM

Each tasks is a simple `html` script that runs a some javascript.

```sh
python -m http.server -d <project_folder>
```

## When serving with wasm
Make sure the http server supports `Content-Type: application/wasm` otherwise the browser will try to parse `.wasm` files as text and fail

what could be a good server for it?

## Why wasm for browser simulations?
compiled ahead of time -> less instructions per second wasted for iterpretation, dynamic typing, garbage collection, etc. Can be optimized with common CPU based optimizations like SIMD and caches and multithreading

## How to build project
Follwing examples use a thin JavaScript wrapper from `pkg` folder generated by `wasm-pack build --target web`

## Inspect wasm
Useful online tools
[WebAssembly binary code explorer](https://wasdk.github.io/wasmcodeexplorer/)
[WebAssembly wat2wasm editor](https://webassembly.github.io/wabt/demo/wat2wasm/index.html)


CLI for `.wat` & `.wasm` exploration

```sh
sudo apt-get install wabt
wat2wasm hello.wat # will produce hello.wasm binary

wasm-objdump -x hello.wasm # will print details about the binary
```
