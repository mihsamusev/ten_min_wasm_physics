# ten_min_wasm_physics
Port of physics simulation demos from the great YouTube channel "Ten Minute Physics" to WASM with Rust. All credits belong to Matthias MÃ¼ller and the great lectures on his [website](https://matthias-research.github.io/pages/tenMinutePhysics/) and [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTG_vrRdKYfrpqCv_WV4eyA). 

The goal of this repository is to:
- port physics simulation code and demos to browser using Rust + WASM
- come up with reusable components for building and simulating your own scenes
